Made a simple site displaying my stuff in a better way than this readme ever could:
Inve1951.github.io/BetterDiscordStuff

Want to buy me a coffee? Find my PayPal link on above site.
Safe your money. PayPal randomly locked my account. They refuse to tell me why and refuse to restore my access to it.

I mostly write my plugins in coffeescript.
I will release the source of fully featured (finished) code in coffee/.
